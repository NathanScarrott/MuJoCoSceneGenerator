VISION ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:
This image may show a process flow diagram, factory layout, room, or other space. Analyze it carefully:
- If it's a process diagram: Translate the workflow into a physical factory layout
- If it's a room/space: Recreate the layout, furniture, and objects you see
- Pay attention to text labels, arrows, symbols, and spatial relationships
- Look for sequential process steps, production lines, or equipment stations
- Consider both the logical flow and physical arrangement

**CRITIQUE YOUR WORK TO ENSURE ALL COMPONENTS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED ACCURATELY**
